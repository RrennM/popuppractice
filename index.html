			  		<p>So, I've been wanting to make something like this on my portfolio site for my portfolio section. Right now, I have this side scrolling image carousel, which is cool, but I didn't code it myself. I just interpreted it from Overstack and Bootstrap and made it suit my needs. It works alright, but I dunno.</p>
			  		<p>I'm in the freelancing class portion of my SkillCrush starter code and it's telling me I need to make a services page. I'm not 100% sold on the idea because I have a single page, static site built right now and "adding a page" is kind of the anti-idea of having a single page site. So, while I need to add a section to that site for my services, I figured I would also rework the portfolio section to something more creative.</p>
			  		<p>This isn't the final edition by any means. I have a feeling I may run into some issues when I go to style the "Click me" buttons* (keyword) by changing them into a/img's to show the projects. Until then, this will have to do and these pictures can show off the process. I like it. I hope to complete both sections by tomorrow, if not tonight.</p>
			  		<p>Also, the reason jQuery is kind of used is because I figured out first through jQuery, the process of identifying which button was clicked. Then I reverse engineered it into JavaScript, so I'm not technically using jQuery.</p>
